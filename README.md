# Coding Ninjas Files

## Why this Repository??

I am an aspiring `software developer`, coming from the field of `Electronics and Communincations`. I picked up on this field in my last two years of college and have been learning and working on it. After working on a few projects by myself, I realised that I need a stronger foundation in the field of `development` and `programming`.  
That is where `Coding Ninjas` came into picture. In the last `1 year`, they have been provided me with the neccessary tools to build myself as a programmer. I have gotten better with `problem solving` and `problem understanding`.  
These files here are the proof of my progress and my learnings under them. Knowing that others also might be in a similar boat, I have made a repo for
    - for my own benifit and logs
    - for my peers to go through any solutions for their problems

I have also added `.md` file for some of the concepts I think are important, and have written the notes to my understanding.  
If anyone going through them has a better way to **solve**, **document** or _add any other upgrades_, please do raise a `PR` and let us make a nice community for all the aspiring devs coming out here.
