# Comparing Sorting Algorithms between Bubble, Selection and Insertion Sort

- for partially sorted arrays, `Insertion Sort` works best as extra steps are not taken if the comparison's condition is failed.
- `Bubble Sort` and `Selection Sort` traverse through the `entire array`.
- when there is an array with `duplicates`, choosing `Bubble Sort` and `Insertion Sort` would be the better options as `Selection Sort`, will not maintain the `relative order` of the `duplicate elements`. This is also called the `stability` of an algorithm.
