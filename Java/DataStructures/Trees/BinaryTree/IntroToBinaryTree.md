A binary tree is a type of tree that has a maximum number of 2 noodes for each root.
Important terms:
    1) node-> one individual data point.
    2) root-> the top most node.
    3) child-> it is the node connected to the root. In a binary tree, there can only be a maximum of 2 children per root.
    4) parent-> this is the node which is branches out to other children.
    5) siblings-> when two share the same root(parent node), they are called sibling nodes.
    6) leaf-> a node is called a leaf if they do not have children.
